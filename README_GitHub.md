## 🎯 Why?

Here are few reasons why I made this:

- **I wanted to learn more about cybersecurity and ethical hacking.**
- **I wanted to make something that will help other people understand and learn more about security testing.**
- **I wanted to make my own framework from scratch, because most frameworks that are available on github are either outdated or overly complicated.**
- **I wanted to create a professional-grade educational tool with real functionality.**

### 📊 Extra Facts:

- **Yes, I know, I could've used existing frameworks like Metasploit, but I didn't want to make things super-complicated and annoying.**
- **No, this does not contain any malicious code. If you want to customize this and add your own modules, then you can.**
- **This framework focuses on education and authorized testing only.**
- **All modules include built-in safety checks and authorization verification.**
